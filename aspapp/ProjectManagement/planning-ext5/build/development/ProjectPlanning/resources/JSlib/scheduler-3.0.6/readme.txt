Thanks for your downloading the Ext Scheduler! 

Ext Scheduler is a powerful JavaScript scheduling tool built on the fantastic Ext JS framework (made by Sencha Inc). It can be used for task planning, facility management, project management, resource allocation and more. It is very easy to setup and customize according to your business needs and you can style each individual element in the chart by using just simple CSS. 
Note: To view the examples you need to run them in a web server context, since they use Ajax to load the chart data.
If you are new to Ext JS or if you want to improve your existing Ext JS skills, we also offer an introduction course that covers the most important aspects of the platform. For more information please visit http://www.bryntum.com/training/.
