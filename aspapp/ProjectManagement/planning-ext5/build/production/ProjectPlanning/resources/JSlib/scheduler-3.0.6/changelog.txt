3.0.0     2015-01-07

    We're excited to announce the public GA release of Ext Scheduler 3.0. The code base has been upgraded to
    run on Ext JS 5.1.0, which adds interesting new features like touch support, responsive capabilities and grid widgets to the Scheduler component.
    The main feature of the release is the new "calendar view". This shows events in a calendar-like interface with days running horizontally
    and hours running vertically. Additionally, we have added a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the scheduler component. You can of course read
    all about the CRUD manager in our guide section of our documentation site. There is of course much more to explore in 3.0, so please check out our 3.0 blog post. http://www.bryntum.com/blog/ext-gantt-ext-scheduler-3-0-ga-available
    We would be very happy to hear your feedback and please report any bugs in our forums: http://bryntum.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=33

    [SUPPORTED EXT JS VERSIONS]
    - 5.1.0

    [KNOWN ISSUES]

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - Ext JS 5 support
    - Export plugin is now supported with Ext JS 5. Buffered grids are supported which gives the ability to export large amounts of data.
    - The Export plugin performance has been improved which means smaller html fragments and less stress for the browser.
    - You can now write your own custom exporters since the updated Export plugin is extensible. A new type of exporter has been implemented: Multi page (vertical). It fits the data horizontally and iterates over pages vertically.
    - Introduced a new config 'mode' and methods getMode/setMode. In further releases 'orientation' is marked as deprecated in favor of 'mode'
    - Added a 'crisp' theme CSS file (see 'theming' sample)
    - Improved support for touch devices. You can resize, drag drop events as usual. Creating new events is done by first doing tap-and-hold for 1000ms (configurable) and then drag.

    [API CHANGES]
    - Sch.column.timeAxis.Horizontal made public
    - Sch.column.timeAxis.Vertical made public
    - Added a new 'trackerConfig' config object to the Sch.feature.DragCreator class
    - Signature of Sch.model.view.TimeAxis#getPositionFromDate method is enhanced: new optional argument isEnd is added. Required only for calendar view
    - Added a new event 'eventrepaint' to the SchedulerView class which fires after an event has been repainted.
    - Added new "setViewPreset" / "getViewPreset" methods to the Sch.mixin.TimelinePanel class.
    - Added a new "setRowHeight" method to the Sch.mixin.SchedulerPanel class.
    - BREAKING: 'select', 'deselect', 'selectionchange' events fired for Event selection have been renamed to "eventXXX".
    - BREAKING: 'defaultConfig' config property changed to 'exportConfig' since Ext 5 uses 'defaultConfig' internally.
    - BREAKING: 'getXYFromDate' removed from TimelineView, use 'getCoordinateFromDate' instead
    - BREAKING: 'getDurationInBusinessDays' removed from Sch.util.Date.
    - The load mask is no longer bound to the event store by default, it's now bound to the store Ext JS uses for the rows. You can
      always choose which store to use with the loadmask by using the 'loadmask' config view property.

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #1549: Scheduler CalendarView resize autoresponsive
    - Fixed #1771: Weekview sample broken
    - Fixed #1778: Scheduler looses scroll position in IE when timeline is clicked
    - Fixed #1782: Rows are out of sync in vertical scheduler after fitColumns call

    - Fixed #1795: Click on event in week view scrolls to top of the view

3.0.0-beta-1 2014-09-25

    We're excited to announce the first public beta release of Ext Scheduler 3.0. The code base has been upgraded to
    run on Ext JS 5.0.1, which adds some great new features like touch support to the Scheduler component. The main feature
    of this Scheduler release is the new "calendar view". This shows events in a calendar-like interface with days running horizontally
    and hours running vertically. There is a new sample called "weekview", which we encourage you to try out. Additionally, we have added
    a new CRUD manager, which makes it a lot easier to handle loading and saving data in the scheduler component. You can of course read
    all about the CRUD manager in our guide section of our documentation site. The PHP sample has been modified to use the new capabilities of this class.

    Starting from this release, we no longer support IE7 since Ext JS 5 has dropped support for it.

    This is a beta release, so expect some rough edges here and there. We would be very happy to hear your feedback and
    please report any bugs in our new Ext Scheduler 3.x forums: http://bryntum.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=33

    - Renamed "Sch.plugin.SummaryColumn" to "Sch.column.Summary". This type of column doesn't need to be included in the grid plugins collection anymore.

    - The private method `floorDate` of `Sch.data.TimeAxis` class, when called with `relativeToStart : false` and `increment` > 1 will now
      adjust the passed date according to the nearest snapping point (for example `floor` for the date 2014/01/18 with unit DAY and increment 4
      will return 17, as the beginning of the following 4 days interval). If you rely on this method (you shouldn't generally)

2.2.0     2013-03-29
    This is the first official release supporting Ext JS 4.2. This is a quite major release with plenty of new features and refactorings.
    As of this release, we now support IE 10. We have added support for the new Neptune theme, as well as RTL support (see new samples).
    For an in-depth review of the changes in this release, please see our blog.

    We have increased our test coverage too, if you find any bugs please report them in our Assembla bug tracker.


    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - IE 10 support added
    - The default row height synchronization mechanism in Ext JS was replaced with a much faster implementation, which does
      not require access to the DOM. As a result, very small row height values are now supported too.

    [API CHANGES]
    - Default value for "lockedGridDependsOnSchedule" config option is changed to true. This option was also made private,
      it is deprecated and subject for removal in any following release, please do not use it.
    - The "scheduleclick/scheduledblclick/schedulecontextmenu" events now include the resource model instance in the signature
      (for both in horizontal and vertical modes). The event object goes after it (Fixed #223).

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #626: Tooltip for event - wrong placement
    - Fixed #667: Investigate Sch.util.Patch usage with CMD

2.2.0-beta-1    2013-02-08

   This is the first 2.2 beta release compatible with Ext JS 4.2 beta. A few tests are failing when running on 4.2.0.265
   but most of these tests pass (except buffering related ones) if you run against the latest Ext nightlies. You can read
   more about the details of the upgrade process on our blog: http://www.bryntum.com/blog/road-to-ext-scheduler-2-2-upgrade-guide .
   The blog post will be posted shortly. There are a few API changes that might be breaking depending on how you're using the component.

    [API CHANGES]
    - BREAKING: forceFit now defined on Panel, it was previously on the View. Compatibility patch installed.

     (normally a regular Ext.grid.Panel)

2.1.0-beta-1 2012-05-03

    This is a first beta release based on Ext JS 4.1-final. It will not work with any Ext 4.0.x version. The main feature of this release is performance,
    which is greatly improved with a new optimization mode (see "lightWeight" option)

    [FEATURES / ENHANCEMENTS]
    - added a new configuration option "lightWeight" (enabled by default). With this option, the scheduler does not create a separate
      table cell for each time interval in the bottom timeline row. Instead, it creates a single column, providing the most lightweight DOM footprint
      possible and much better performance. The downside of this optimization is that its not possible to customize every cell in the scheduler view.
      Because of that, this option is automatically disabled if a `timeCellRenderer` function is provided.

    [API CHANGES]

    [BUG FIXES]
    - Fixed #176: TreeView not refreshed after eventStore load, loadData
    - Fixed time header cell text overflow issue in IE

2.1.0-alpha-1     2012-03-09
    This is an alpha release based on Ext JS 4.1, tested only against Beta 3. It will not work with any Ext 4.0.x version.
    You can download Ext JS 4.1 B3 here: http://cdn.sencha.io/ext-4.1.0-beta-3.zip (extract it to the same folder containing Ext Scheduler 2.1):
    This release is not bug-free, and we would very much appreciate help in testing it and reporting anything you find.

    The main goal of this 2.0 release is to upgrade to Ext JS 4.1 which brings better performance. Our initial tests show a 2x speed increase for the initial rendering.
    We have also done some refactoring, and there is one breaking change: you must now use a new Sch.data.EventStore for your events.
    For guidance on using this very simple store, please see this forum thread: http://www.bryntum.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=1737#p10365
